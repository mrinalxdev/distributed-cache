# Building a Distributed Cache

What we will be hitting in this project 

- [ ] LRU Cache from scratch : in memory js map + doubly linked list (O(1))
    - [x] Get method
    - [x] Set method
    - [x] Moving the node to head
    - [x] Adding the node to head
    - [x] removing the node
    - [x] evicting the tail

- [ ] Redis : `ioredis` using redis with nestJs for the first time

Can we make it scalable ? if yes then how ?? How are we making it in a backend service ?? If no then why not ??
